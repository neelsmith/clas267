# clas267

This repository hosts chronological graphs built as part of course projects in CLAS267, "Archaeology and Time," at Holy Cross in the spring semester of 2017.  By using common identifiers, we integrated material from more than unified network of roughly 250 events

## What's here

- collected data sets:
    - catalogs of events
    - formal models of synchronisms
- for each project, visualizations and automated summaries of shortest paths from a given event to the epoch of Nabonasar (747 BCE).  See links to individual projects below.
- source code for all software used in this project
